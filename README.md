# Thermal Priming and Marine Heatwave on Coral Bleaching
The repository deposits Matlab and R codes used in the study "The Loss of Beneficial Thermal Priming on Global Coral Reefs"

The coral bleaching database ('CBdbV2') is available at https://zenodo.org/records/6780843

Matlab scriptes are used to calculate priming and marine heatwave metrics and extract metric values at different levels and corresponding to bleaching reports in each bleaching severity category. R scripts are used to perform statistical analysis and mixed-effects regression models.
