# Thermal Priming and Marine Heatwave on Coral Bleaching
The repository contains Matlab and R codes used in the study "The Loss of Beneficial Thermal Priming on Global Coral Reefs"

Matlab scriptes are used to calculate priming and marine heatwave metrics and extract metric values at different levels and corresponding to bleaching reports in each bleaching severity category. R scripts are used to perform statistical analysis and mixed-effects regression models.
