This folder contains the Matlab codes for quantifying the druation and magnitude of priming condtions and MHWs (DHD). The source data for doining these calculations includes: 1) the MHW heat stress input (HS) can be downloaded from 
https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_sst.php which were preprocessed for only preserving positive SST anomalies and fillling a value from the adjacent ocean cell for the land grid cells that are actually coral ceels according to the global coral map; 
2) the mask of global coral map can be found from https://doi.org/10.34892/t2wk-5t34; 3) the warmwater coral bleaching database for filtering out heat stress is available at https://zenodo.org/records/6780843
